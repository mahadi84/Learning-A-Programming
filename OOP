02. Inheritance(Reusability)
03. Encapsulation(hiding data and complexity)
04. Polymorphism(Object to take many forms)

01. Class, Abstract Class, Interface, Traits
02. Object
03. Property
04. Method(Constructor & Deconstructor)
05. Access Modifiers
06. 'this' keyword


================= 01. Data Abstraction (Data hide) =============================

-hide the complex implementation details and show only the essential features of an object to a developer
-focus on what the object does rather than how it does it.
-allows developers to build systems that are easier to manage, understand, and maintain.

Example:
public abstract class Car {
    public abstract void Engine();
    public abstract void brake();
}

public class Sedan extends Car {
    @Override
    public void Engine() {
        // Complex logic to start a sedan engine
    }

    @Override
    public void brake() {
        // Complex logic to brake a sedan
    }
}

Explanation: 
The Sedan class provides specific implementations for these methods. 
The details of how each method works are hidden from the user of the Sedan class, providing a simplified and abstracted view.


============================ 02. Inheritance(Code Reusability, Method Overriding, Extended Functionality )==================================
Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a new class to inherit properties and behavior (methods) from an existing class. 
The new class called a subclass (or derived class), inherits the fields and methods of the superclass (or base class). 
Inheritance promotes code reusability and can lead to a hierarchical classification.

============================ 03. Encapsulation(hiding data and complexity) ============================
-bundling the data (fields) and methods (functions) into a single unit or class and restricting access to some of the object's components. 
-using access modifiers such as private, protected, and public. 

Example:
Bank Account: Let's consider a real-world example of a bank account. We'll encapsulate the account balance and provide methods to interact with the balance.
// BankAccount.java
public class BankAccount {
    // Private fields for encapsulation
    private String accountNumber;
    private double balance;

    // Constructor to initialize the bank account
    public BankAccount(String accountNumber, double initialBalance) {
        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
        this.balance = initialBalance;
    }

    // Public method to deposit money
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
            System.out.println("Deposited: " + amount);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Deposit amount must be positive");
        }
    }
}
------------
// Main.java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a new bank account
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount("123456789", 1000.00);

        // Deposit money
        account.deposit(500.00);
        System.out.println("Current balance: " + account.getBalance());

}
